"""Euler Project 4
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome
made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

"""
Could be made more efficient by starting at 999 and decrementing,
but run time is <1 second, so not really necessary.
